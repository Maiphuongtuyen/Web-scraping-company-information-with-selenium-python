# Web-scraping-company-information-with-selenium-python
In this study, I will utilize a list of tax IDs from Vietnamese companies to search for and extract various pieces of information. This includes details such as the company's address, name, business entity, industry, phone number, representative, the source link, and its operational status. All data will be gathered from masothue.com.


I have attached a crawldata file that contains the empty fields I used in this code. You can view it in my GitHub repository. My crawldata Excel file will use the tax IDs to search for and collect business information, which will then be saved into these empty field columns: company, industry, business entity, representative, phone number, status, address, and the source link.
To begin, I will install the necessary libraries for this project, specifically Selenium and WebDriver Manager. 
!VERY IMPORTANT!: Itâ€™s important to ensure that the code file for this project is located in the same directory as your crawldata file. You can find the current directory of your project by executing the following code:

import os
current_directory = os.getcwd()
print("Current path of this project:", current_directory)
